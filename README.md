To setup almost everything just run `./install.sh`, it will take care of proper linking, brew bundle installs, etc.
It will prompt you about several other things to finalize setup which are not written down in code (yet?).

Features:
- brew & brew bundle
- zsh with antigen
- python3 with jupyter + ipykernel
- opencv3
